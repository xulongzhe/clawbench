**From Terminal to Palm** — An AI workstation built for mobile.

Brings the full power of AI coding agents to browsers and mobile apps, creating a true mobile development environment. File browsing, code editing, AI conversation, Git operations, scheduled tasks — one app does it all.

Core Advantage: Native passthrough of AI capabilities (tool calls, extended thinking, Skills, MCP) with zero adaptation cost, fully preserving the power of coding agents. Unlike other mobile AI tools that are merely "remote controllers," ClawBench is a full-featured mobile workstation — files, code, Git, AI, scheduled tasks, TTS, get real work done on your phone without needing a PC online.

- **Supported Platforms**: Browser (PC / Tablet / Phone), Android App, PWA
- **AI Backends**: CodeBuddy, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex, Qoder CLI, VeCLI, DeepSeek TUI, Pi

## Technical Architecture

ClawBench's core philosophy:

- **Zero-Adaptation Passthrough**: Instead of reimplementing AI capabilities, ClawBench uses AI coding agent CLIs as backend engines, wrapping them as HTTP API + SSE streaming interfaces via a web server. This fully preserves tool calls, extended thinking, Skills, MCP, and all other capabilities with zero adaptation cost. The frontend only handles rendering and interaction — all intelligent logic is natively provided by the CLI.
- **AI Handles Changes, I Handle Review**: The project does not provide direct file editing capabilities — all modifications are done through AI. The focus is on building an excellent Markdown and code preview experience, along with interaction with AI during preview — select code or text to ask AI questions or request modifications for rapid iteration.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **A PC (Linux / macOS / Windows)**: To run the ClawBench server, with at least one AI coding agent CLI installed (CodeBuddy, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex, Qoder CLI, VeCLI, DeepSeek TUI, or Pi)
- **A phone**: Install the [ClawBench Android App](https://github.com/xulongzhe/clawbench/releases), or use a mobile browser (Chrome recommended) to access the server address

### Download & Start

Download the latest ZIP package from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/xulongzhe/clawbench/releases), extract and you're ready:

```bash
wget https://github.com/xulongzhe/clawbench/releases/latest/download/clawbench-linux-amd64.zip
unzip clawbench-linux-amd64.zip
cd clawbench
./server.sh
```

That's it — on every startup, ClawBench automatically scans for installed AI CLI tools, generates minimal agent configs for each detected backend, and auto-discovers available models and thinking effort levels. No manual configuration needed.

> A random password is auto-generated on first startup and printed to the console. Save it securely.

Once deployed, access `http://server-ip:20000` from your phone app or mobile browser:

- **Phone App**: Native integration, auto-connect, full feature support
- **Mobile Browser**: **Chrome** recommended — supports installing as a PWA app (Add to Home Screen) for a near-native experience

### Customize Agents

Auto-generated agent configs use minimal defaults (no model lists or thinking effort levels — these are auto-discovered at runtime). To customize model lists, system prompts, icons, etc., edit the YAML files in `config/agents/` and restart the server:

```bash
# Edit an existing agent
vim config/agents/claude.yaml

# Add a new agent (use example templates as reference)
cp config/agents/claude.yaml.example config/agents/my-claude.yaml
```

Each `.yaml.example` file contains complete configuration fields and descriptions for that backend. They serve as reference templates only and are not auto-loaded.
